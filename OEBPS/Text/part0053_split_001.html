  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes445" id="notes445n">1</a>. Berkshire Hathaway chairman’s letter，1988.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes446" id="notes446n">2</a>. The tax code exemption applied to LIFO inventory liquidations. For tax purposes Rockwood used LIFO accounting，which let it calculate profits using the most recent cocoa-bean prices，which minimized taxes. Correspondingly，cocoa beans were carried in inventory at old prices. A large taxable profit would therefore occur if it sold the inventory.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes448" id="notes448n">4</a>. At the onset of the exchange period，Accra cocoa beans，which made up half of Rockwood’s 13million-pound pile，were trading at $0.52 a pound. The price dropped to $0.44 per pound by the conclusion of the exchange period. The price of these beans had hit a high of $0.73 per pound in August 1954，causing candy companies to shrink the size of their 5 candy bars.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes450" id="notes450n">6</a>. From the 1988 chairman’s letter in the Berkshire annual report to shareholders，which contains a brief description of the Rockwood transaction.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes451" id="notes451n">7</a>. The speculator’s return on the contract also reflects his funding cost. For example，if the speculator broke even on a three-month contract——net of his fee——the contract would actually be unprofitable，considering the speculator’s funding cost.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes452" id="notes452n">8</a>. In the futures market，the difference between a speculator and a hedger (or“insured”) is essentially whether an underlying position in the commodity exists to be hedged.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes453" id="notes453n">9</a>. Interviews with Tom Knapp and Walter Schloss，as well as Buffett.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes454" id="notes454n">10</a>. Warren Buffett letter to David Elliott，February 5，1955.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes455" id="notes455n">11</a>. Based on its profile in Moody’s Industrial Manual，Rockwood traded between $14.75 and $85 in 1954 and between $76 and $105 in 1955. Buffett held on to the shares through 1956. Profit on the trade is estimated. Rockwood traded above $80 a share during early 1956，based on the Graham-Newman annual report.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes456" id="notes456n">12</a>. In the letter to David Elliott noted above (February 5，1955)，Buffett explains that Rockwood is his second-largest position (after Philadelphia &amp; Reading，which he did not disclose) and writes that Pritzker“has operated quite fast in the past. He bought the Colson Corp. a couple years ago and after selling the bicycle division to Evans Products sold the balance to E L. Jacobs. He bought Hiller &amp; Hart about a year ago and immediately discontinued the pork-slaughtering business and changed it into a more or less real estate company.”Pritzker，he writes，“has about half the stock of Rockwood，which represents about $3 million in cocoa value. I am quite sure he is not happy about sitting with this kind of money in inventory of this type and will be looking for a merger of some sort promptly.”He had studied not just the numbers but Jay Pritzker.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes457" id="notes457n">13</a>. Initially he had bought the stock from Graham-Newman when he was a stockbroker，after a minor mistake on an order from them caused them to DK (“don’t know，”or repudiate) the order. Warren kept the stock.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes458" id="notes458n">14</a>. Before 2000，investors and analysts routinely sought and received nonpublic information that would be an advantage to them in trading stocks. This gradual flow of information，which benefited some investors at the expense of others，was considered part of the efficient workings of the capital markets and a reward for diligent research. Warren Buffett and his network of investor friends profited significantly from the old state of affairs. Ben Graham was questioned extensively about this practice before Congress in 1955. He commented that “a good deal of information from day to day and month to month naturally comes to the attention of directors and officers. It is not at all feasible to publish every day a report on the progress of the company... on the other hand，as a practical matter，there is no oath of secrecy imposed upon the officers or directors so that they cannot say anything about information that may come to their attention from week to week. The basic point involved is that where there is a matter of major importance it is generally felt that prompt disclosure should be made to all the stockholders so that nobody would get a substantial advantage in knowing that. But there are all degrees of importance，and it is very difficult to determine exactly what kind of information should or must be published and what kind should just go the usual grapevine route.”He added that all investors may not be aware of the grapevine，but，“I think that the average experienced person would assume that some people are bound to know more about the company [whose stock they are trading] than he would，and possibly trade on the additional knowledge.”Until 2000 that was，in effect，the state of the law.</p>

  <p class="calibre11">While a full discussion of insider trading is beyond the scope of this book，the theory of insider trading was promulgated with SEC Rule 10b-5 in 1942，but “so firmly entrenched was the Wall Street tradition of taking advantage of the investing public，”as John Brooks puts it in The Go-Go Years，that the rule was not enforced until 1959，and it was not until the 1980s that anyone seriously questioned the duties of people other than insiders under insider-trading laws. Even then，the Supreme Court affirmed，in Dirks v. SEC，463 U.S. 646 (1983)，analysts could legitimately tell their clients this type of information，and the Supreme Court also noted in Chiarella v. United States，445 U.S. 222 (1980)，that “informational disparity is inevitable in the securities markets.”To some extent，there was understood to be some benefit to the market of a gradual leakage of inside information; in fact，how else was the information to get out? The practice of business public relations and conference calls had not developed.</p>

  <p class="calibre11">In these 1980s cases，however，the Supreme Court defined a new“misappropriation”theory of insider trading，in which inside information that was misappropriated by a fiduciary could lead to liability if acted upon. Then，largely in response to the Bubble-era proliferation of “meeting and beating consensus”earnings and the “whisper numbers”that companies began to suggest to favored analysts that they were going to earn，in 2000，through Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure)，the SEC broadened the misappropriation theory to include analysts who selectively receive and disseminate material nonpublic information from a company’s management. With the advent of Reg. FD，the “grapevine”largely ended，and a new era of carefully orchestrated disclosure practices began.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes459" id="notes459n">15</a>. At the end of 1956，after the dividend was paid，Warren owned 576 shares trading at $20，worth $11, 520.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes460" id="notes460n">16</a>. He registered the securities in his own name，rather than his brokers’，so the checks came straight to his home.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes461" id="notes461n">17</a>. Interviews with George Gillespie，Elizabeth Trumble，who heard this story from Madeline. Warren heard it for the first time at his fiftieth birthday party，from Gillespie. Apparently Susie had never mentioned it to him.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes462" id="notes462n">18</a>. More than five decades later，Howie recalls this as his first memory. While that may seem improbable，in “Origins of Autobiographical Memory，”Harley and Reese (University of Chicago，Developmental Psychology，Vol. 35，No. 5，1999) study theories of how childhood memories are recalled from the earliest months of life and conclude that this phenomenon does occur. One of the explanations is parents who repeat stories to their children. A gift from Ben Graham——probably significant to Warren–might plausibly be recalled by Howie from infancy because at least one parent helped him imprint it solidly in memory by discussing it so much.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes463" id="notes463n">19</a>. Interview with Bernie and Rhoda Sarnat.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes464" id="notes464n">20</a>. This story also is cited in Janet Lowe’s Benjamin Graham on Value Investing: Lessons from the Dean of Wall Street. Chicago: Dearborn Financial Publishing，1994.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes465" id="notes465n">21</a>. Interview with Walter Schloss.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes466" id="notes466n">22</a>. Warren Buffett letter to the Hilton Head Group，February 3，1976.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes467" id="notes467n">23</a>. Schloss was starting the partnership with $5, 000 of his own capital，a risky arrangement that left him nothing on which to live. Buffett got him help with housing from Dan Cowin. Ben Graham put in $10，000 and had some of his friends do so too; eight of Schloss’s friends put in $5, 000 each. Schloss charged 25% of profits，“but that’s it. If the market went down，we would have to make up the loss until my partners were whole.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes468" id="notes468n">24</a>. Knapp was a security analyst at Van Cleef，Jordan &amp; Wood，an investment adviser.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes472" id="notes472n">28</a>. Graham was born May 9，1894. He decided to shut down Graham-Newman when he was sixty-one，but the last Graham-Newman shareholder meeting was held on August 20，1956.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0029.html#notes473" id="notes473n">29</a>. Jason Zweig says in a July 2003 Money article，“Lessons from the Greatest Investor Ever，”that “From 1936 to 1956，at his Graham-Newman mutual fund，he produced an average annual gain of more than 14.7% vs. 12.2% for the overall market——one of the longest and widest margins of outperformance in Wall Street history.”This record does not reflect the impressive performance of GEICO，which was distributed to the shareholders in 1948.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes474" id="notes474n">1</a>. At times he had said he wanted to be a millionaire by age thirty.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes475" id="notes475n">2</a>. Interview with Ed Anderson.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes476" id="notes476n">3</a>. “Newman and Graham predated A. W. Jones，which everybody thinks is the first hedge fund，”Buffett says. A. W. Jones is best known as the first promoter of the concept of hedging the risk in stocks with short sales. However，its fee structure，partnership arrangement，and flexible investing approach——that is，the classic hedge fund as the term is technically defined——were pioneered much earlier，by Graham if not others as well.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes477" id="notes477n">4</a>. Interview with Chuck Peterson.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes478" id="notes478n">5</a>. The first partnership agreement provided: “Each limited partner shall be paid interest at the rate of 4% per annum on the balance of his capital account as of December 31 of the immediately preceding year as shown by the Federal Income Tax Return filed by the partnership applicable to said year’s business，said interest payments to be charged as expenses of the partnership business. In lieu of a separate computation of interest for the period ending December 31，1956，each limited partner shall be paid 2% of his original capital contribution，said payments to be charged as expense of the partnership business for said period. In addition each of the limited partners shall share in the overall net profits of the partnership，that is，the net profits of the partnership from the date of its formation to any given point of time in the proportions set opposite their respective names.”The total interest of the partners added up to 23/42 or 50% of the total interest in the earnings (Certificate of Limited Partnership，Buffett Associates，Ltd.，May 1，1956). The agreement to share in the losses was an amendment to the partnership agreement on April 1，1958.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes479" id="notes479n">6</a>. According to Joyce Cowin，both Buffett and her own husband，Dan Cowin，who had been introduced to Buffett by Fred Kuhlken，ran money separately for Gottschaldt and Elberfeld.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes491" id="notes491n">18</a>. According to Tom Knapp，one thing Dodge and Buffett had in common was their tightfistedness. Even when he later became one of Buffett’s richest partners，Homer Dodge would angle for a free canoe from a canoe maker. He knew every route into New York City from both La Guardia and JFK airports，and took convoluted trips by bus and subway and on foot rather than hire a cab.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes492" id="notes492n">19</a>. The Dodges chose a slightly different deal. Buffett’s share of the profits would be only 25%，but the amount he could lose was limited to his capital，initially only $100.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes495" id="notes495n">22</a>. Warren Buffett’s first letter to partners，December 27，1956.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes496" id="notes496n">23</a>. During the war，people bought Liberty Bonds，which paid low interest rates，as a patriotic duty. When rates subsequently rose，the bonds traded “below par”——face value. Stock promoters offered shares to Liberty Bond owners in exchange for the par value of the bonds. Thus bondholders thought they were getting $100 worth of stock for a bond selling in the market for，say，$85，when in fact the stock was worth little if anything. Salesmen also promised some buyers board seats，according to Hayden Ahmanson，who told Buffett this.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes497" id="notes497n">24</a>. From 1928 to 1954，the manual was published in five volumes annually as Moody5 Manual of Investments，one volume each for government securities; banks，insurance companies，investment trusts，real estate，finance and credit companies; industrial securities; railroad securities; and public-utility securities. In 1955，Moody’s began publishing Moody’s Bank and Finance Manual separately.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes498" id="notes498n">25</a>. Buffett says Hayden Ahmanson gave him this version of events.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes499" id="notes499n">26</a>. Buffett: “He was my partner in National American insurance. Dan didn’t have a lot of money，so he was using his money that he had originally planned to put in the partnership，and borrowed some money too.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes500" id="notes500n">27</a>. Under the Williams Act，passed in 1968，you could not do this today，nor could Howard Ahmanson buy back the stock piecemeal. The act requires buyers to make a “tender offer”that puts all sellers on a level playing field under the same price and terms.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes501" id="notes501n">28</a>. According to Fred Stanback，when Buffett had“bought all he could pay for，”he also let Stanback start buying.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes502" id="notes502n">29</a>. A year later，Buffett sold the National American stock for around $125 (to the best of his memory) to J. M. Kaplan，a New York businessman who had reorganized and headed Welch’s Grape Juice in the 1940s and ’50s and was later known for his philanthropy. Kaplan eventually sold the stock back to Howard Ahmanson.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes503" id="notes503n">30</a>. See，for example，Bill Brown，“The Collecting Mania，”University of Chicago Magazine，Vol. 94，No. 1.，October 2001.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes504" id="notes504n">31</a>. Interview with Chuck Peterson. This was insurance proceeds from her husband’s estate. By then，Buffett had decided to offer his partners several choices of risk versus reward. Mrs. Peterson chose a fee structure that shifted more of both to Warren. He had to beat the market by 6%，not 4%，before earning anything. But he got one third of everything he made above that. Under this structure，only Warren’s capital was at risk for the 25% payback-of-losses provision. Certificate of Limited Partnership，Underwood Partnership，Ltd.，June 12，1957.</p>

United States &amp; International Securities Corp. was formed amid much fanfare in October 1928 by Dillon，Read &amp; Co. and promptly sank into ignominy，becoming a cigar butt by 1950. Clarence Dillon，the founder of Dillon，Read，was called before the Pecora hearings in 1933 to explain how Dillon，Read obtained control of US&amp;FS and US&amp;FS，which were capitalized at $90 million，for $5 million.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes507" id="notes507n">34</a>. Quote is from Lee Seeman. Buffett confirms the substance of the statement. The intriguing question is who or what prompted Wiesenberger to make the phone call.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0030.html#notes508" id="notes508n">35</a>. Lee Seeman’s recollection in an interview is that Dorothy Davis made the comparison.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0032.html#notes562" id="notes562n">1</a>. Estimated. Buffett was managing $878，211 at the end of 1958 in six partnerships. The $50, 000 Glenoff Partnership was formed in February 1959. By the end of 1959，the partnerships’ market value had grown to $1, 311，884.

Sanborn sent its customers paste-over revisions each year showing new construction，changed occupancy，new fire-protection facilities，and changed structural materials.

The widow of the deceased president was reportedly selling 15, 000 shares because her son was leaving the company. Phil Carret owned 12, 000 shares.</p>

Buffett had become friendly with the company’s CEO，Parker Herbell，whom he said the rest of the board treated as an “errand boy.”Herbell supported the plan to separate the investments from the map business，and had facilitated some of its underpinnings，such as this study.</p>

In the second quarter of 1962，the Dow fell from 723.5 to 561.3，or 23%. In the first half of that year，the partnership saw a loss before payments to partners of 7.5%，compared with a loss of 21.7% including dividends for the Dow—— the partners had a 14.2% outperformance.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0032.html#notes599" id="notes599n">38</a>. Buffett’s phrase is a clever reworking of Graham’s original. In The Intelligent Investor: “The sovereign virtue of all formula plans lies in the compulsion they bring upon the investor to sell when the crowd is buying and to buy when the crowd lacks confidence”(Intelligent Investor，Part I: General Approaches to Investment VI: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side，1949 edition). And in Security Analysis: “It would require bond investors to act with especial caution when things are booming and with greater confidence when times are hard”(Security Analysis，Part II: Fixed-Value Investments，Xl: Specific Standards for Bond Investment，1940 edition).</p>

Marginalized into a ghetto north of downtown called the Near North Side，they lived in dilapidated，aging tenements for which unscrupulous landlords charged high rents. In 1957，the Omaha Plan，a communitywide study，proposed redevelopment of the Near North Side，but bond issues were defeated. A budding civil-rights movement led by college students at Creighton University，the Urban League，and other civic groups had worked to improve black employment and end segregation of teachers in the public schools since 1959.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0034.html#notes656" id="notes656n">37</a>. The market for soybean oil was not large，a key element in the scheme. It would be impossible for a single individual to amass enough capital to corner the market for，say，oil or treasury bills.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0034.html#notes657" id="notes657n">38</a>. Most accounts published about the scandal incorrectly refer to oil floating on top of water in the tanks.</p>

Haupt was a securities dealer who traded both stocks and commodities and was a member of the NYSE; thus，he was required to meet the exchange’s net capital rules (which state that capital must be 1/20 of its total liabilities). SEC Rule 15c3–1 regulates broker-dealer net capital. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness Standard，2% of net capital is required today，compared to 5% in the 1960s.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0034.html#notes664" id="notes664n">45</a>. American Express at the time was the only major U.S. public company to be capitalized as a joint stock company rather than a limited liability corporation. This meant its shareholders could be assessed for deficiencies in capital.“So every trust department in the United States panicked，”recalls Buffett.“I remember the Continental Bank held over 5 percent of the company，and all of a sudden not only do they see that the trust accounts were going to have stock worth zero，but they could get assessed. The stock just poured out，of course，and the market got slightly inefficient for a short period of time.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0034.html#notes665" id="notes665n">46</a>. The Travelers Cheque was American Express’s main product. The company introduced the card defensively when banks developed credit cards as a countermeasure to the Travelers Cheque.</p>

According to Everett Allen in Children of the Light: The Rise and Fall of New Bedford Whaling and the Death of the Arctic Fleet (Boston: Little，Brown，1983)，yearly ificome from whaling amounted to $12 million by 1854，making New Bedford probably the richest city per capita in the world before the Civil War.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0035.html#notes687" id="notes687n">12</a>. More than thirty ships were lost in the disaster of 1871，most from New Bedford. The devastating cost of 1871 in financial and human terms laid waste to the industry. Whalers began building metal boats that could break through the ice in a futile quest to save what remained of the whaling industry.</p>

The North was no workers’ paradise，but in the South there were virtually no laws against child labor，excessive work hours，or unsafe work conditions. The mills owned the workers’ houses and the stores where they shopped，controlled their water supply，owned their churches，and effectively controlled the state governments and the courts. Machine-gun-bearing state militia prevented strikes. The workers were more like sharecroppers. Nearly ten thousand Northern workers had lost their jobs when the textile industry marched southward to the Carolinas in search of cheaper labor when air-conditioned plants were constructed after World War II.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0035.html#notes708" id="notes708n">33</a>. He also felt that Seabury’s strategy of trying to bypass the New York“converters”——who turned the company’s “gray goods”into finished dyed goods and sold them to customers——was a serious misjudgment.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0035.html#notes709" id="notes709n">34</a>. “If you’re in a business that can’t take a long strike，you’re basically playing a game of chicken with your labor unions because they’re going to lose their jobs，too，if you close down....And there’s a lot of game theory involved. To some extent，the weaker you are，the better your bargaining position is——because if you’re extremely weak，even a very short strike will put you out of business; and the people on the other side of the negotiating table understand that. On the other hand，if you have a fair amount of strength，they can push you harder. But it is no fun being in a business where you can’t take a strike.”Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffer and Charlie Munger，“The Incentives in Hedge Funds Are Awesome，But Don’t Expect the Returns to Be Too Swift，”Outstanding Investor Digest，Vol. XVI，No. 4 &amp; 5，Year End 2001 Edition.</p>

A former Plaza Hotel employee confirms that the seventeenth floor did have a few exceptionally small rooms，with bad views，and that it was possible to haggle the room prices down，especially later in the evening.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0035.html#notes711" id="notes711n">36</a>. Interview with Ken Chace Jr.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0035.html#notes712" id="notes712n">37</a>. According to Roger Lowenstein’s Buffett，Ken Chace was the source. Warren does not recall any of the details，including talking to Jack Stanton，but he says Ken Chace’s account is most likely correct.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0035.html#notes713" id="notes713n">38</a>. Mary Stanton Plowden-Wardlaw，letter to Warren Buffett，June 3，1991. Stanley Rubin set it up.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0036.html#notes730" id="notes730n">9</a>. Buffett and his chief administrative officer John Harding chose a set of representative large-cap stocks，in effect creating a market index. Buffett did not want to execute the trade through a brokerage firm because the broker kept the proceeds from the sale and paid no interest to him. Harding contacted university endowment funds. Buffett went personally to Chicago to get shares. The idea of lending directly to a short-seller was so novel at the time that most universities passed. However，Harding was able to borrow about $4.6 million of stock.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0036.html#notes731" id="notes731n">10</a>. Buffett put $500, 000 into treasury bills in the first quarter of 1966.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0037.html#notes738" id="notes738n">3</a>. Buffett tells the story，which Charlie Heider recalls and found unforgettable. Parsow doesn’t recall it.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0037.html#notes739" id="notes739n">4</a>. Both Byer-Rolnick and Oxxford were acquired by Koret in 1967.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0037.html#notes743" id="notes743n">8</a>. “That’s not negotiating，”claims Munger.“It’s just using pithy examples to steer people to what they should be doing. Sure，it’s persuasion，but it’s legitimate persuasion.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0037.html#notes744" id="notes744n">9</a>. The Kohns were planning to sell for a quarter less than the tangible net assets of the business. Gottesman had done a private placement of debentures for Hochschild-Kohn with Equitable Life that year and was familiar with its financial statements. His mother-in-law，her brother Martin Kohn，and another sister were equal stockholders who owned a class of preferred stock in the company. The preferred stock was in arrears，not having paid a dividend in some time. In effect，therefore，they could have controlled the business. They had not exercised this privilege，however. The common stock was owned largely by their relative Louis Kohn，from another branch of the family and second in command after Martin Kohn.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0037.html#notes748" id="notes748n">13</a>. Buffett mentioned the problem to the partners in his mid–1966 letter but stressed the more important question of buying a company rather than a stock. Another factor was the banks，which had also started issuing credit cards，cutting further into Hochschild-Kohn’s edge.</p>

Buffett says Rosner told him he got Aye Simon’s consent to sell the business by saying something along the following lines: “And to hell with you. If you’re going to second-guess it，you come down and run the store.”The relationship was irretrievably broken.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes752" id="notes752n">1</a>. Including Buffett’s stock in Data Documents，a separate investment，the Buffetts’ net worth was somewhere between $9.5 and $10 million.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes753" id="notes753n">2</a>. Buffett’s description，in Patricia E. Bauer’s “The Convictions of a Long-Distance Investor，”Channels，November 1986，was，“One time we had a dog on the roof，and my son called to him and he jumped. It was so awful——the dog that loves you so much that he jumps off the roof...”——leaving the reader to wonder how the dog got on the roof.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes759" id="notes759n">8</a>. At high rates of return，and paying no tax. If a shareholder had taken $0.06 a share——after paying a tax on the $0.10 dividend——and put it in the market earning 5% on average，he would have about $0.42. If Buffett had kept that $0.10，and compounded it at the 21% he earned over the past forty years，a shareholder，who would have been slightly diluted over the years，would be $135 richer. Looking at it on a larger scale，the tiny dividend “cost”Berkshire shareholders over $200 million as of 2007.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes765" id="notes765n">14</a>. By September 30，1967，the partnership had $14.2 million in treasuries and short-term debt out of a total $83.7 million invested.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes766" id="notes766n">15</a>. Alice was a friend of Ringwalt’s; the family believed she may have once had some sort of“under-standing”that might have led to marriage until Ernest put a stop to it. Ringwalt had a reputation as a ladies’ man，but Alice also kept house for her father，and “no one was good enough for her，”Buffett says.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes769" id="notes769n">18</a>.

Buffett heard of the burlesque stars from Ringwalt.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes770" id="notes770n">19</a>. Berkshire paid Heider a $140, 000 fee for the transaction.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes771" id="notes771n">20</a>. Interview with Bill Scott.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes772" id="notes772n">21</a>. With the company closely held，it took only a week to round up the necessary 80% shareholder approvals.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes773" id="notes773n">22</a>. In his book，Ringwalt says he was only driving around looking for a metered place on the street because he refused to pay a parking garage.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes774" id="notes774n">23</a>. This was a reason why National Indemnity would not need reinsurance，or protection from other insurers，which was both expensive and would make it a dependent.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0038.html#notes775" id="notes775n">24</a>. Ringwalt also was included in the shareholder register of Diversified Retailing in 1976 (he actually sold 3, 032 shares back to the company in its tender offer).</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0039.html#notes781" id="notes781n">6</a>. Grinnell’s founder，Congregational minister Josiah Grinnell，pastor of the First Congregational church in Washington，D.C.，bolted from its doors in 1852 when his Southern congregation took exception to his abolitionist views. It was Grinnell who sought advice from the famous New York Herald editor Horace Greeley and who heard the words that every schoolchild in America would subsequently learn without knowing their source: “Go West，young man，go West!”The phrase was originally written by John Soule in the Terre Haute Express in 1851.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0039.html#notes787" id="notes787n">12</a>. King first said this in Cleveland in 1963 and used variations of it in most major speeches thereafter. He called the idea that you can’t legislate morality a “half-truth.”“It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me，”he said，“but it can keep him from lynching me，and I think that is pretty important.”</p>

Galbraith in an interview by Israel Shenker，“Galbraith: ’29 Repeats Itself Today，”published in the New York Times on May 3，1970.“The explosion in the mutual funds is the counterpart of the old investment trusts. The public has shown extraordinary willingness to believe there are financial geniuses in the hundreds. Financial genius is a rising stock market.

Wallace later apologized to the black community for his role.</p>

Buffett explained that he expected stocks to yield about 6.5% after tax for the next ten years，roughly the same as a“purely passive investment in tax-free bonds.”Even the best managers，he said，were unlikely to do better than 9.5% after tax.

Buffett indulged in a bit of score-settling with the underwriters in his letter to partners of December 26，1969，saying that the deal was pitched “with a heavy weight”placed on a comparison to Sperry &amp; Hutchinson，the nearest competitor，but shortly “before the stock was to be offered，with the Dow Jones Industrials much lower but S&amp;H virtually unchanged，they indicated a price far below their former range.”(Blue Chip at the time had declined significantly.) “We reluctantly agreed and felt we had a deal but，on the next business day，they stated that our agreed price was not feasible.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0043.html#notes884" id="notes884n">12</a>. It was a little unclear what the filling stations’ actual beef was. They had given out Blue Chip stamps and made money doing it. If there were five stamp companies in California，they might have given out stamps that cost more，and it isn’t clear that they would have made more money——they might have made less.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0043.html#notes885" id="notes885n">13</a>. This takes into account the approximately 90, 000 shares of Blue Chip Stamps that were still tied up in BPL because of the delay in the sale.</p>

DRC continued to issue these notes until 1978，for a total of $1.527 million. During the first year the notes were also payable at the payee’s demand. Apparently the notes were reissued with this term eliminated in 1972 (according to the 1972 DRC financial statements).</p>

See，son of Mary See and a founder of the firm，had died，and Charles See，his brother and executor of his estate，mentioned to an attorney acquaintance while on vacation in Hawaii that he might want to sell. The attorney told Bob Flaherty，who worked for Scudder，Stevens，and Clark，and Flaherty talked to Ramsey，who was also a client of the firm.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0043.html#notes898" id="notes898n">26</a>. Buffett and Munger paid 11.4x trailing twelve months earnings for See’s (i.e.，a price equal to over eleven years’ worth of the company’s earnings——at the past twelve months’ earnings rate). This was a remarkably high price/earnings ratio for Buffett，who rarely paid more than ten times earnings. Paying more than book value was also unprecedented. Susie told at least one friend that he “bought it for her，”because of her chocolate obsession，which sounds like something he might have said as an endearment.</p>

Buffett was particularly involved in tax aspects of the deal. He wrote a detailed memorandum outlining a proposed structure for the company’s trademarks in order to obtain a tax basis equal to the effective purchase price without incurring the tax costs that a sale would entail under tax law at the time，such as depreciation recapture and investment tax-credit recapture. Price Waterhouse，the accountants for See’s，apparently were pleased that Buffett had done their job and wrote a memo concurring with his proposal and explaining how it would be executed (letter from Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. to William F. Ramsey，January 18，1972).</p>

Buffett’s reasoning in situations like this and Berkshire was that he needed the stock to get control. However，his allies could have kept their stock and voted with him. Indeed，in his younger days when he had less capital，Buffett had arranged such voting blocks.</p>

In a letter dated later in 1972，Buffett the teetotaler also says，“Maybe grapes from one little eighty-acre vineyard in France are really the best in the whole world，but I have always had a suspicion that about 99% of it is in the telling and about 1% is in the drinking.”</p>

At an anniversary party for the Thompsons a few weeks earlier，the Buffetts’ cook served what came to be known throughout Omaha as the “poisoned chicken.”Except for a rabbi and his wife，who ate tuna，everyone present came down with salmonella. By then，Buffett was so wellknown that the episode made the Omaha World-Herald. Interview with Rabbi Meyer Kripke.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0043.html#notes921" id="notes921n">49</a>. According to a friend，Susie began to verbalize this attitude around the late 1960s. She later said these words，as quoted，to Charlie Rose in an interview.</p>

A letter from Senator Ed Muskie to Buffett，September 23，1971，said that Muskie was “especially intrigued by this concept，”which Hughes and Rosenfield had passed along to him. Later，the same notion，with the more memorable and attention-grabbing name “misery index，”played a role in President Jimmy Carter’s failure to win a second term.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes931" id="notes931n">7</a>. The way Hughes told this story (with Dick Schneider) in his autobiography，The Man from Ida Grove (Lincoln，Va.: Chosen Books，1979)，differed slightly from the press account. Hughes freely discusses his reputation as a “mystic”and mentions Rosenfield’s backing. He does not mention Buffett but recalls the meeting as taking place in a California motel room instead of Washington，as reported. On the plane on the way home，he saw“a vision of a red button”that would launch “an awesome nuclear attack”and says he realized that，as President，he could not press the button. After asking God’s guidance，he decided not to run for President.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes935" id="notes935n">11</a>.

Michael Casey，new director of special projects brought in after the Sun story，described the atmosphere as a “minimum-security prison，”based on his experience working in prisons and mental hospitals，in “Midlands News”of the Omaha World-Herald，March 10，1974. According to Casey’s account，he was forced to resign from Boys Town six months later and stated that reforms were window dressing. Father Hupp says Casey left because his job was done——but Casey was an outspoken ex-convict，which may have made him “too hot.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes944" id="notes944n">20</a>. The Sun had a “four-way”staff that reported stories that would appear in seven editions of the paper. These were the reporters working on the Boys Town story.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes945" id="notes945n">21</a>. According to Paul Williams，in Investigative Reporting and Editing，Boys Town got school-aid funds and state welfare and gasoline tax funds. While these were “relatively small change”in the context of the overall budget，about $200, 000 a year，the discrepancy was real and pointed to other possible problems.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes946" id="notes946n">22</a>. Transcript，Mick Rood interview with Msgr. Nicholas Wegner. Wegner speaks of“this gal down there in the Lincoln welfare department [who] tried to make a big thing，a big blow out of this...”which，he thought，was personal rather than institutional. Nevertheless，he implied that Boys Town might move out of state if the regulators pestered it too much because “our bylaws say WE’RE NOT OBLIGED TO STAY HERE.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes949" id="notes949n">25</a>. Jeannie Lipsey Rosenblum described his appearance at that time in an interview.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes950" id="notes950n">26</a>. As a religiously affiliated organization，Boys Town was entitled to an exemption for the first two years and could have filed with the archdiocese of Omaha. But it had filed separately anyway.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes951" id="notes951n">27</a>. According to Paul Williams，the footwork in Philadelphia was done by Melinda Upp，a Washington reporter whom he previously had tried to hire. Finally，the call came: Are you sure you want this? she asked. The IRS charged a dollar a page and it was 94 pages long. The answer was，Hell，yes.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0044.html#notes963" id="notes963n">39</a>. Michael D. LaMontia，director of the State Department of Public Institutions，which oversaw Boys Town，called the Sun’s criticisms those of a “vocal minority”that should be ignored in a letter to Wegner，May 25，1972. The Sun，he said，speaks“from a very low profile and is really not heard by many people. The person being attacked can let it die a natural death....”He referred to the reporters as “scavengers”and “professional losers.”Possibly Mr. LaMontia was merely being empathetic，but his tone seemed a little more charged-up than that.</p>

Schmitt was angry because，among other things，Boys Town’s marketing domicile had backfired: Kinsolving wrote a followup story in the Washington Evening Star，“Boys Town Money Machine”(November 4，1972)，and datelined it Boys Town，Nebraska. Schmitt (incorrectly) felt that he had no right to do so.</p>

In 1973，Boys Town actually raised more money than in 1972 (over $6 million)，according to the Omaha World-Herald (March 21，1973). The main result of the exposé and reforms was increased transparency and accountability over how the money was spent.</p>

I also like becoming the largest shareholder in substantial enterprises——on the theory that this adds a possible plus factor to investment performance.”Charles T.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0047.html#notes1060" id="notes1060n">28</a>. Buffett’s trading style that year suggested he might be pessimistic about the economy and was preparing for a downturn. He wrote straight covered-call options on Kennecott Copper and down-and-out options，a more sophisticated type of covered call that limits the downside and upside within a specified range，on several stocks such as Ford Motors，General Motors，and Black &amp; Decker. Selling calls on the latter three economically sensitive stocks was not a market call，but does suggest that he was more pessimistic than optimistic about the economy.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0048.html#notes1114" id="notes1114n">31</a>. Ibid. This lawyer was so particularly ferocious that the author was asked not to mention his name.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0048.html#notes1115" id="notes1115n">32</a>. A thick file of documents produced in response to the SEC’s February 1975 subpoena illustrates several points: 1) it contained no evidence that Buffett bought on inside information or expecting a takeover; 2) Buffett had become expert on water company regulation and ratemaking，and his interest and expertise in this narrow subject was prodigious; 3) this aspect of the investigation must have been intrusive and an embarrassing form of déjvù，as it included production of his correspondence with Forbes that attempted to dear his name.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0048.html#notes1116" id="notes1116n">33</a>. Partly because of state restrictions on how much stock any one insurance company could hold，the diagram was more complicated than it would have been otherwise.

During Buffett’s testimony，In the Matter of Blue Chip Stamps，Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated，HO-784，Friday，March 21，1975，p.125，he acknowledged that he and Munger had been buying shares of Wesco in the open market during a tender offer and Rickershauser had advised him to stop，saying that they should use only tender offers to accumulate further shares (which they did). Rickershauser interjected，“I want the record to be clear that I did not tell them it was illegal to do what was done. I told them it would be hard to convince somebody that in hindsight they may not have intended to do what they did. You can swear me in if you want to on that one. I didn’t want to be right.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0048.html#notes1119" id="notes1119n">36</a>. The SEC apparently considered Buffett，Munger，and Guerin’s interests and the companies a controlled group for purposes of tender offers. The combination of Warren (11%)，Susie (2%)，Munger and his partners (10%)，Berkshire Hathaway (26%)，and Diversified (16%) controlled 65% of Blue Chip’s stock. Warren and Susie owned 36% of Berkshire and 44% of DRC. Munger owned 10% of DRC. DRC owned 15% of BRK and 16% of BC. BC owned 64% of Wesco.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0048.html#notes1120" id="notes1120n">37</a>.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1146" id="notes1146n">16</a>. According to Personal History，this contract would have given the pressmen the highest wages in the nation and security from layoffs. Negotiations broke down in part because the Post refused to hire back the workers who had damaged the presses.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1147" id="notes1147n">17</a>. According to Personal History，fifteen former Post pressmen pleaded guilty to various misde- meanor charges. Six who had damaged presses and committed more serious crimes were jailed.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1149" id="notes1149n">19</a>. With the press strikes and Watergate affair behind her，Katharine Graham began to focus on growth at the Washington Post in the mid-1970s. Up until then，the company didn’t have sufficient profits and there was “little more than a hit-or-miss strategy” for growth (Personal History). Sales and earnings started to take off in 1976，around the time that they started buying back company stock. Earnings per share were $1.36 in 1976 vs. $0.36 in 1970. Return on equity was 20% compared to 13%. Profit margin grew to 6.5% from 3.2%. And it kept improving from there (Value Line report，March 23，1979).</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1167" id="notes1167n">37</a>. By 1974，the whole insurance industry was producing what rating agency A. M. Best called “unbearable” losses of $2.5 billion from a vicious price war and inflation of everything from car repairs to lawsuits. (A.M. Best Company Comment on the State of and Prospects for the Property/Liability Insurance Industry，June 1975.) The states were also passing “no-fault” insurance legislation，which meant that insurers had to pay for an accident regardless of who caused it. The federal government also slapped price controls on the industry during the Middle East war. Meanwhile，the devastating stock market of 1973~1974 had wiped so much value from GEICO’s stock portfolio that for every share of stock，investments that had once been worth $3.90 were now worth a dime a share (Leonard Curry，“Policy Renewed: How GEICO Came Back from the Dead;” Regardie’s，October/November 1982).</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1168" id="notes1168n">38</a>. GEICO had $500 million in premiums and would have needed capital of $125 million to meet regulatory and rating agency standards for leverage.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1170" id="notes1170n">40</a>. Interview with Jack Byrne.“The bastards at Travelers had passed me over for president for Ed Budd，” recalls Byrne (who likes to tell this story and tells it often).“A million dollars invested with me is now worth a billion，and a million dollars invested with Ed Budd is now worth $750, 000. And I used to be pissed，but obviously I’m more mature about it now. Well，I’m still pissed” This story is also recounted in William K. Klingaman，GEICO，The First Forty Years. Washington，D.C.: GEICO Corporation，1994.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1173" id="notes1173n">43</a>. GEICO had too little capital under regulatory standards to ensure its ability to pay claims on all its policies.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1182" id="notes1182n">52</a>. Wallach had invited big insurers to buy up 40% of GEICO’s reinsurance treaties，giving them until June 22 to make their decision to participate. Not enough insurers signed up. Wallach was supposed to decide by Friday，June 25，whether to shut GEICO down. He extended the deadline and，in mid-July，revised his rescue plan——requiring only 25% of GEICO’s premiums to be taken up by the insurance pool and lowering the amount of capital they needed to raise by yearend to $50 million. Reginald Stuart，“Bankruptcy Threat Fails to Change Status of GEICO，” New York Times，June 26，1976; Reginald Stuart，“The GEICO Case Has Landed in His Lap，” New York Times，July 4，1976; Matthew L.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1183" id="notes1183n">53</a>. National Indemnity was a specialty company，not yet so large or well-known that it would cause too much push-back on the grounds of helping a competitor. Buffett’s other insurers，as will be seen，were struggling.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1184" id="notes1184n">54</a>. Who knows what General McDermott actually wrote，but any endorsement at all from him would have carried weight among insurers.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1185" id="notes1185n">55</a>. Some of the people instrumental in making it happen were former GEICO employees，according to Byrne.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1189" id="notes1189n">59</a>. Leonard Curry，“Policy Renewed” According to some sources，Butler also had an instrumental role in convincing Gutfreund to underwrite the deal.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1190" id="notes1190n">60</a>. Without a doubt it had not. Among other things，GEICO had failed to disclose a change in method of calculating loss reserves，which had enabled it to boost profits by $25 million during the second and third quarters of 1975.“In the Matter of GEICO et. al.，” October 27，1976.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1193" id="notes1193n">63</a>. An indication of “aftermarket support” was a principal component in underwriters’ assessments of how a stock might trade once it was listed. The presence of aftermarket support helped prevent a “busted deal” in which the underwriter had to buy back the offering with the firm’s own capital.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1194" id="notes1194n">64</a>. Byrne’s recollection is that Tom Harnett，the New York superintendent，helped rally the industry to get behind the reinsurance. Harnett，he believes，had an incentive because the New York guaranty fund was prefunded and had invested in Big Mac New York City bonds，which were selling at a fraction of their par value. The insolvency funds in effect had evaporated in the wake of New York City’s financial crisis.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1195" id="notes1195n">65</a>. Byrne has told this story more vividly in times past. In Roger Lowenstein’s Buffett: The Making of a American Capitalist (New York: Doubleday，1996)，he supposedly said to Sheeran，“Here’s your fucking license. We are no longer a citizen of the state of New Jersey.” He calls Sheeran“the worst insurance commissioner ever.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0049.html#notes1196" id="notes1196n">66</a>. Disgruntled employees，hearing the news about their jobs，started throwing policies out the top-story window.“Files were floating all around North Jersey in the air，” says Byrne. Nobody knew this until GEICO moved the claims office to Philadelphia，“when we went to move the files and they weren’t there.” Byrne estimates the lost data cost the company as much as $30million~40 million in excess claims. GEICO also gave up its license in Massachusetts. It stopped writing business in many other states without surrendering the right to do so in the future. In total，the company nonrenewed 400，000 out of its 2.2 million policyholders.</p>

Ogden，in Legacy，cites Annenberg as saying he &amp;dined to buy the Washington Times-Herald from Colonel McCormick and convinced McCormick to sell to the Grahams despite their reservations about Phil Graham’s drinking and mental stability.

While most mergers are done for stock (if only for tax reasons)，this subtle underlying psychology gives the seller a slight advantage. The willingness to issue stock implies，by its nature，that the buyer prefers the seller’s business to his own. The exception is using an overpriced stock to buy an underpriced company from a naive seller，which aggressive buyers sometimes do，although not nearly as often as they think.</p>

The sleeping Warren famously did not notice whether Susie was there. In one story related by Racquel Newman，she decided to drive to Dottie’s to play music at around ten or eleven at night，ran out of gas in a snowstorm at midnight on her way home，and instead of waking Warren，called a friend and went on an all-night obstacle-filled expedition to a gas station on the interstate，delayed by a tractor-trailer jackknifed on the free- way. She finally got home shortly before dawn. Warren never knew she was gone.</p>

In a letter to the Graham Group，September 27，1977，Bill Ruane describes how“This article can well serve as a basis for a discussion of so many things which are central to our economic concerns today. The article not only deals with the central theme of inflation but also with the effects of taxes，rate of return，dividend paying capacity and other elements which are crucial to the appraisal of aggregate values in our economic system.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0050.html#notes1240" id="notes1240n">39</a>. The Buffett Group would take this problem up again and again. Its members were pessimistic about whether the problem could be solved，for they doubted，with good reason，that Congress had the necessary resolve to control the federal budget over the long term.</p>
