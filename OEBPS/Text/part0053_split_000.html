  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0007.html#notes1" id="notes1n">1</a>. This quote，or its variation，“Behind every great fortune there is a great crime，” is cited endlessly without a specific source: for example，in Mario Puzo’s <span class="italic">The Godfather</span> and in commentary on The Sopranos and on the Internet bubble. This pithier version condenses what Honoré de Balzac actually wrote in <span class="italic">Father Goriot</span>:“The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out，because it was properly executed.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes2" id="notes2n">1</a>. Herbert Allen made an exception for Ken Auletta，the first and only time a writer was allowed to attend and write about Sun Valley.“What I Did at Summer Camp” appeared in the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>，July 26，1999.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes3" id="notes3n">2</a>. Interview with Don Keough. Other guests commented on Buffett’s role at Sun Valley as well.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes6" id="notes6n">5</a>. Elephant herds are matriarchal，and the females eject the males from the herd as soon as they are old enough to become dominant and aggressive. Then the solitary males approach herds of females，trying to mate. However，this isn’t exactly the way human elephant-bumping works.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes7" id="notes7n">6</a>. Allen &amp; Co. does not release the numbers，but the conference was said to cost around $10 million，more than $36, 000 per invited family. Whether $5 or $15 million，that pays for a lot of flyfishing and golf over the course of a long weekend. Much of the money pays for the conference’s exhaustive security and logistics.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes8" id="notes8n">7</a>. Buffett likes to tell a joke about having worked his way up to this exalted state: starting from a trailer，then the lodge，then a lesser condo，and so forth.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes9" id="notes9n">8</a>. Herbert Allen’s son Herbert Jr. is usually referred to as “Herb.” However，Buffett refers to Herbert Sr. as “Herb” as a mark of their friendship，as do a few other people.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes10" id="notes10n">9</a>. This portrait of Sun Valley and the impact of the dotcom billionaires is drawn from interviews with a number of people，including investment managers with no ax to grind. Most asked not to be named.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes11" id="notes11n">10</a>. Allen &amp; Co. and author estimate. This is the total assets under management of money managers who attend the conference，added to the personal fortunes of the guests. It represents their total economic power，not their consumption of wealth. By comparison，the capitalized value of the U.S. stock market at the time was about ten trillion dollars.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes14" id="notes14n">13</a>. Buffett had spoken twice before at the Allen conference，in 1992 and 1995.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes15" id="notes15n">14</a>. Buffett and Munger preached plenty to their shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings，but this preaching to the choir doesn’t count.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes17" id="notes17n">16</a>. Buffett’s remarks have been condensed for readability and length.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes18" id="notes18n">17</a>. PowerPoint is the Microsoft program most often used to make the slide presentations so ubiquitous in corporate America.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes19" id="notes19n">18</a>. Interview with Bill Gates.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes20" id="notes20n">19</a>. Corporate profits at the time were more than 6% of GDP，compared to a long-term average of 4.88%. They have since risen to over 9%，far above historic standards.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes21" id="notes21n">20</a>. Over long periods the U.S. economy has grown at a real rate of 3% and a nominal rate (after inflation) of 5%. Other than a postwar boom or recovery from severe recession，this level is rarely exceeded.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes22" id="notes22n">21</a>. American Motors，smallest of the “Big Four” automakers，sold out to Chrysler in 1987.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes23" id="notes23n">22</a>. Buffett is speaking metaphorically here. He admits to investing in things with wings a time or two，and not with good results.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0008.html#notes24" id="notes24n">23</a>. Buffett first used this story in his 1985 chairman’s letter，citing Ben Graham，who told the story at his tenth lecture in the series Current Problems in Security Analysis at the New York Institute of Finance. The transcripts of these lectures，given between September 1946 and February 1947，can be found at http://www.wiley.com//legacy/products/subject/finance/bgraham/ or in Benjamin Graham and Janet Lowe，The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham: Selected Writings of the Wall Street Legend.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes33" id="notes33n">1</a>. Interview with Charlie Munger.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes34" id="notes34n">2</a>. Parts of Munger’s explanation are taken from three lectures on the psychology of human misjudgment，and his commencement address to the Harvard School on June 13，1986，both as found in Poor Charlie’s Almanac，The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger，edited by Peter D. Kaufman. Virginia Beach，Va.: Donning Company Publishers，2005. The rest is from interviews with the author. Remarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes35" id="notes35n">3</a>. Interview with Charlie Munger.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes36" id="notes36n">4</a>. Munger’s driving habits are described in Janet Lowe，Damn Right.t Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons，2000.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes37" id="notes37n">5</a>. Required to produce a doctor’s note to prove he was blind in one eye and qualified for a special license at the California Department of Motor Vehicles，Munger refused and offered to take out his glass eye instead.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes38" id="notes38n">6</a>. Munger’s doctor used an older type of surgery that had a higher complication rate. Rather than blame the doctor，Munger claims he should have done more research on doctors and types of surgery himself.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes39" id="notes39n">7</a>. Buffett’s interest in such products as pig stalls and egg counters is limited; he reviews some of these statistics in a summarized form.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0009.html#notes40" id="notes40n">8</a>. Despite the complaints of passengers，Buffett has never，to the author’s knowledge，been responsible for an accident，only near heart attacks.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0010.html#notes42" id="notes42n">1</a>. Buffett predicted up to 6% growth in the market per year，but gave historical ranges of no growth，and the underlying math suggested that figure could be high. The 6% was a hedged bet.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0010.html#notes43" id="notes43n">2</a>. S&amp;P is Standard &amp; Poor’s Industrial Average，the most widely used measure of the overall stock market’s performance. S&amp;P includes reinvested dividends. Berkshire does not pay a dividend.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes53" id="notes53n">7</a>. Zebulon Buffett，letter to Sidney Buffett，December 21，1869.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes54" id="notes54n">8</a>. Sidney’s store was originally named Sidney H. Buffett and Sons，where both brothers，Ernest and Frank，worked. The store originally sat at 315 South 14th Street downtown，where it stayed until its closing in 1935. Frank took over as sole proprietor after Sidney’s death in 1927. In 1915，Ernest opened a branch store，which moved west to 5015 Underwood Avenue in Dundee in 1918. (At the time Dundee was a separate town，eventually annexed by Omaha.)</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes55" id="notes55n">9</a>. A third child，named Grace，died in 1926. Three more，George，Nellie，and Nettie，died at young ages in the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes56" id="notes56n">10</a>. Warren Buffett quoting Charlie Munger.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes57" id="notes57n">11</a>. According to Doris Buffett，she was born Daisy Henrietta Duvall and began to call herself Henrietta (after her mother) rather than Daisy by the time she arrived in Omaha.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes60" id="notes60n">14</a>. Interview with Charlie Munger. His mother told him this story，although，he notes，“she may have been garnishing it just a bit.” But others recall the notebook.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes61" id="notes61n">15</a>. In letters like one to his son Clarence in January 1931，he analyzed the effect of railroad automation on unemployment and suggested that the best solution for the Great Depression was a great public-works project. It seems ironic that he and his son Howard became such foes of Roosevelt when he initiated the Works Progress Administration after the next election.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes62" id="notes62n">16</a>. Ernest Buffett letter to Fred and Katherine Buffett，undated，“ten years after you were married，” circa June 1939.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes67" id="notes67n">21</a>. Bryan’s “Cross of Gold” speech，delivered on July 9，1896，has been called the most famous political speech in American history. Bryan is best remembered for opposing the gold standard and for getting involved in the Scopes case，where the famous lawyer Clarence Darrow made him look foolish for testifying against teaching evolution in schools. In fact his interests were broader and less extreme and his contemporary influence greater than he is generally remembered for today.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes68" id="notes68n">22</a>. Family files. Bernice blamed her father for marrying into a family with genetic mental defects，begetting children who would suffer the result.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes69" id="notes69n">23</a>. Leila was a freshman at Nebraska during the 1923~1924 academic year，according to the Cornhusker yearbook，when Howard was a junior. On Coffee with Congress，Howard noted that they met in the fall of 1923，when Leila was 19. Because students usually entered college at 17，this suggests she worked for about two years before starting. She pledged Alpha Chi Omega as a freshman in the 1923~24 school year，but was still classified as a freshman in 1925，suggesting she went home to work on the newspaper and returned in the spring of 1925.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes70" id="notes70n">24</a>. Probably in fall 1923.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0012.html#notes71" id="notes71n">25</a>. Howard was secretary of the Innocents (Daily Nebraskan，September 27，1923). This group persisted for many more years，until，as Buffett puts it，“the day came when they couldn’t find thirteen who were innocent.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0013.html#notes80" id="notes80n">1</a>. Even so，only three in a hundred Americans owned stocks. Many had borrowed heavily to play the market，entranced by John J. Raskob’s article，“Everybody Ought to Be Rich” in the August 1929 Ladies’ Home Journal and Edgar Lawrence Smith’s proof that stocks outperform bonds (Common Stocks as Long-Term Investments. New York: The MacMillan Company，1925).</p>

New York: Harper &amp; Row，1969. Roger Babson’s famous warning，“I repeat what I said at this time last year and the year before，that sooner or later a crash is coming，” was useless.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0013.html#notes82" id="notes82n">3</a>. Kennedy，Freedom from Fear. Kennedy notes that interest payment on the national debt rose from $25 million annually in 1914 to $1 billion annually in the 1920s due to World War I，accounting for one-third of the federal budget. The actual budget in 1929 was $3.127 billion a year (Budget of the U.S. Government，Fiscal Year 1999——Historical Tables，Table 1.1——Summary of Receipts，Outlays，and Surpluses or Deficits: 1789~2003. Washington，D.C.: Government Printing Office).</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0013.html#notes83" id="notes83n">4</a>. By the bottom tick on November 13，the market had lost $26 to $30 billion of its roughly $80 billion precrash value (Kennedy，op. cit.，Brooks，op. cit.). World War I cost approximately $32 billion (Robert McElvaine，The Great Depression: America，1929~1941.

The wave crested in December 1931 with the failure of the Bank of the United States，an officialsounding institution that had nothing to do with the government. The $286 million collapse broke a record，took down 400, 000 depositors，and was understood by everyone——in one sense or another——as a failure of public trust (Kennedy，Freedom from Fear). It kicked the quivering legs out from under the banking system and sent the already battered economy into collapse.</p>

Nebraska football fans still informally call themselves Bugeaters. Grasshoppers love drought conditions and contribute to soil erosion by devouring every living plant down to the black earth. From 1934–1938 the estimated national cost of grasshopper destruction was $315.8 million (about $4.7 billion in 2007 dollars). The region encompassing Nebraska，the Dakotas，Kansas，and Iowa was the epicenter of grasshopper infestation. See Almanac for Nebraskans 1939; also Ivan Ray Tannehill，Drought: Its Causes and Effects.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0016.html#notes170" id="notes170n">17</a>. Joan Fugate Martin，who remembers the date，in an interview corroborated the story. She called the boys perfect gentlemen，but had nothing to add about their self-confessed awkwardness.</p>

This letter，which was at one time one of Buffett’s treasured heirlooms，resided in his desk drawer for many years，written on a piece of yellow paper. He can no longer locate it. Through a trade association，Ernest lobbied against chain stores and worked for legislation that would levy special taxes on them——in vain.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0017.html#notes198" id="notes198n">1</a>. This particular prank letter circulated widely in the mid-twentieth century. Where the idea originated and from whom Warren might have gotten a copy is unknown. What makes this fondly recalled prank funny (putting aside whether or how often he actually perpetrated it and upon whom) is how it plays to the commonplace interest in hidden lives and feet of clay. Its essence is a tribute to the power of shame.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0017.html#notes199" id="notes199n">2</a>.

From 1933，when the U.S. went off the gold standard，through 1947，the Consumer Price Index fluctuated wildly，spiking over 18%. The history of the Federal Reserve under inflationary conditions was short and provided little evidence to support an opinion either way.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0019.html#notes221" id="notes221n">8</a>. Carnegie was a salesman for Armour &amp; Co.，covering the Omaha territory; the compatibility of his views with Buffett’s temperament probably owes something to a shared Midwestern ethos.</p>

In one version of this story，told by a high school friend of Buffett’s who was not present，Kerlin was too smart to fall for it and never made it to the golf course. Whatever happened，Buffett’s version is，not surprisingly，funnier.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0021.html#notes242" id="notes242n">1</a>. The class size is approximate because Woodrow Wilson had，in effect，two classes graduating in parallel (February and June graduates); students like Warren could shift from February to the previous June by taking a few extra credits.

Jolson，a vaudeville singer，was the most popular stage entertainer of the early twentieth century. He made famous such songs as “You Made Me Love You” “Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody，”“Swanee，”“April Showers，”“Toot，Toot，Tootsie，Goodbye，” and“California，Here I Come.” He performed “My Mammy” in blackface in the 1927 movie The Jazz Singer，the first feature film to enjoy widespread commercial success. Jolson was voted “Most Popular Male Vocalist” in a 1948 Variety poll on the back of a film about his life，The Al Jolson Story，which repopularized him to a younger generation. Performing in blackface would be considered racist today but was ubiquitous and unremarkable at the time.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0023.html#notes300" id="notes300n">1</a>. In his memoir，Man of the House (New York: Random House，1987)，the late Congressman Tip O’Neill recalled that his pastor，Monsignor Blunt，said it was a sin for Catholics to go to the Protestant-managed YMCA. O’Neill and a Jewish friend stayed at the Sloane House anyway. The regular rate in the 1930s was sixty-five cents a night，but，O’Neill said，“If you signed up for the Episcopal service，it was only thirty-five cents，with breakfast included. We were nobody’s fool，so we signed up for the thirty-five-cent deal and figured to duck out after breakfast and before the service. But apparently we weren’t the first to think of this brilliant plan，because they locked the doors during breakfast，which meant that we were stuck.” By the 1950s，there was no longer a “pray or pay” deal at the Sloane House.“If there had been” Buffett says，“I would have experienced a revelation and embraced whatever denomination offered the greatest discount.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0023.html#notes301" id="notes301n">2</a>. Buffettis not certain if the smoking deal applied to all three of the Buffett kids or only his sisters，but they all got the $2, 000 on graduation on roughly the same terms.</p>

Due to a legal technicality，this divestiture of GEICO stock was required in a consent order with the SEC in 1948. Graham-Newman violated Section 12(d)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940，although “in the bona fide，though mistaken，belief that the acquisition might lawfully be consummated.” A registered investment company (Graham-Newman was “a diversified management investment company of the open-end type”) cannot acquire more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of an insurance company if it does not already have 25% ownership.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0023.html#notes324" id="notes324n">25</a>.

Graham was born in 1894，the year of one of the biggest financial panics in American history，which was followed by the depression of 1896~1897，the panic of 1901，the panic of 1903~1904 (“Rich Man’s Panic”)，the panic of 1907，the war depression of 1913~1914，and the postwar depression of 1920~1922.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0024.html#notes333" id="notes333n">7</a>. Traditionally，people came to Wall Street in one of two ways. Either they entered the family business by following a relative into the job，or，having no such connection，they“came up through the hawsehole，” to use a nautical expression common on Wall Street at the time，starting young as a runner or board boy and working their way up，like Sidney Weinberg，Ben Graham，and Walter Schloss. Attending business school with the conscious intention of working on Wall Street was essentially unheard of until the early 1950s because most areas of finance，and especially the art of security analysis，had not developed as academic disciplines.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0024.html#notes335" id="notes335n">9</a>. Graham believed that one could be swayed by personality and salesmanship by going to meetings with a company’s management，so this was partly a way of remaining dispassionate. But Graham was also not particularly interested in human beings.</p>

In Security Analysis，Principles，and Technique (New York: McGraw-Hill，1934)，Benjamin Graham and Dodd stressed that there is no single definition of“intrinsic value，” which depends on earnings，dividends，assets，capital structure，terms of the security，and “other” factors. Since estimates are always subjective，the main consideration，they wrote——always——is the margin of safety.</p>

Often this was because the kind of undervalued stocks he liked were illiquid and could not be purchased in large positions. But Buffett felt that Graham could have followed a bolder strategy.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes352" id="notes352n">4</a>. Earl Wilson was the saloon writer for the New York Post. In describing Newsday scribe Jimmy Breslin，Media Life Magazine defined a saloon writer as the purveyor of“a certain style of journalism that’s peculiar to New York，and a bit peculiar in itself，where the writer journeys about the places where ordinary people can be found and writes of their visions of the human condition.”</p>

Vanita，in a Valentine letter to Warren，February 1991，poses the possibility that she “never liked cheese sandwiches and that I just ate them to please.” (In this letter，as at some other times，she spells her middle name “May” instead of“Mae” as in her youth.)</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes355" id="notes355n">7</a>. This description came from various letters from Vanita，reminiscing about her dates with Warren——January 1，1991，February 19，1991，January 1，1994，many undated; Buffett agrees.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes357" id="notes357n">9</a>. Buffett says that，despite her antics，he was never intimidated by Vanita.“I wouldn’t have had the guts to stick Pudgy in a wastebasket，” he says.“I mean，she’d have beaten the hell out of me.” For her part，Vanita later claimed to Fred Stanback that the incident never happened——although she did have some incentive to downplay the histrionic side of her personality to Fred.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes358" id="notes358n">10</a>. As Charlie Munger puts it，Buffett narrowly missed a disastrous marriage when he “escaped the clutches of Vanita.”</p>

Information on William Thompson comes from a variety of sources，including interviews with Warren，Roberta，and Doris Buffett and other family members，and “Presbyterian Minister Reviews Thompson Book，” Omaha World-Herald，January 5，1967; “Old ‘Prof’ Still Feels Optimistic About Younger Generation，” Omaha World-Herald，March 28，1970; “W. H. Thompson，Educator，Is Dead，” Omaha World-Herald，April 7，1981; “O.U. Alumni Honor Dean，” Omaha World-Herald，May 15，1960.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes361" id="notes361n">13</a>. As supervisor of the school system’s IQ testing，Doc Thompson had access to and，according to Buffett，knew Warren’s IQ. Indeed，the IQ test results for the three little Buffetts may have intrigued him，given their remarkably high——and remarkably similar scores.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes362" id="notes362n">14</a>. In an interview，Marge Backhus Turtscher，who attended these services，wondered what on earth motivated Thompson to make the long trip each Sunday to preach at this tiny church. Thompson also once published a book，The Fool Has Said God Is Dead. Boston: Christopher Publishing House，1966.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes363" id="notes363n">15</a>. Susan Thompson Buffett told this story to various family members.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes364" id="notes364n">16</a>. In many patients，rheumatic fever causes mild to serious heart complications (in Howard Buffett’s case，at least moderate complications)，but based on her subsequent health history，Susan Thompson appears to have been among the 20%~60% who escape significant carditis，or long-term damage to the heart.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes365" id="notes365n">17</a>. Warren，Doris Buffett，Roberta Buffett Bialek，Susie Buffett Jr.，and other Buffetts talk of this striking film.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes377" id="notes377n">29</a>. Interview with Sue James Stewart. Susie，a self-described “personal theist，” flirted with Buddhism，a nontheistic religion，all her life and often referred to Zen or to herself as a “Zen person.”It is fair to say she used the terms “Zen”and “theist”loosely.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes390" id="notes390n">42</a>. The United States airlifted food and supplies into West Berlin during 1948 and 1949 during a Soviet blockade in which the Soviet Union attempted to seize the entire city，which had been partitioned after World War II.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0025.html#notes391" id="notes391n">43</a>. Buffett recalls a literal three-hour lecture. A conversation of such length was almost certainly the result of him working himself up to ask the question while Doc Thompson carried on.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc1">Chapter 19</h3>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0026.html#notes392" id="notes392n">1</a>. The net gain on investments was $7, 434. He also put $2, 500 into the account that he’d saved from his pay working at Buffett-Falk.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0026.html#notes393" id="notes393n">2</a>. Delving a little further into Buffett’s reasoning about the valuation of an insurance business: “The stock was trading around forty dollars and therefore the whole company was selling for about seven million. I figured the company would be worth as much as the premium volume，roughly，because they would get the investment income on ‘float’ that was pretty close to dollar-for-dollar，maybe with the premium income. Plus，they’d have the book value. So I figured it would always be worth at least as much as the premium. Now，all I had to do was get to a billion dollars of premium income and I was going to be a millionaire.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0026.html#notes394" id="notes394n">3</a>. This company later became ConAgra. Buffett-Falk had apparently managed a $100, 000 preferred-stock offering for it as an investment banker——at the time not a trivial transaction.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0026.html#notes395" id="notes395n">4</a>. Interview with Margaret Landon，the secretary at Buffett-Falk.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0026.html#notes396" id="notes396n">5</a>. According to Walter Schloss in an interview，the Norman family，who were heirs of Julius Rosenwald of Sears，Roebuck，“received GEICO stock because they were big investors in Graham-Newman. When the Normans wanted to put more money with Graham-Newman，they gave Ben Graham the GEICO stock he had distributed to them instead of putting cash in. Warren is out in Omaha，and he’s buying GEICO. But Graham didn’t know he was selling to Warren，and Warren couldn’t figure out why Graham-Newman was selling it.”The distribution of GEICO stock by Graham-Newman is also described in Janet Lowe’s Benjamin Graham on Value Investing: Lessons from the Dean of Wall Street. Chicago: Dearborn Financial Publishing，1994.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0028.html#notes416" id="notes416n">1</a>. General Douglas MacArthur made a halfhearted run for the nomination but was eclipsed by Taft. He and his former aide Eisenhower were bitter enemies.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0028.html#notes419" id="notes419n">4</a>. This was the same Robert Taft who had cosponsored the Taft-Hartley Act，much favored among businessmen but despised by broad swaths of Americans. In short，Taft represented the extreme end of the party，which made him less likely to capture moderate voters.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0028.html#notes420" id="notes420n">5</a>. Ironically，many in this faction promoted tariffs，government farm supports，and tough labor laws desired by their small-business and farm constituents，even though this may have seemed inconsistent with their other views on government. Another famous member of this group was popular Nebraska Senator Ken Wherry，the “merry mortician，”famous for malapropisms such as calling Indochina “Indigo China，”addressing the chairman as “Mr. Paragraph，”and offering his “unanimous opinion.”Time，June 25，1951. Wherry died shortly before the election.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0028.html#notes421" id="notes421n">6</a>. The leaders of this wing of the party were Henry Cabot Lodge and Nelson Rockefeller，despised by Howard Buffett and like-minded Republicans as rich East Coast Ivy League elitists who abandoned core Republican principles to join forces with Democrats whenever it furthered their own pragmatic interests and those of“big business.”</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0028.html#notes430" id="notes430n">15</a>. The IQ story is a family tale，but since Dr. Thompson was in charge of IQ testing for the whole school system，it has at least some credence. Within the family，Dr. Thompson often tested his daughters and grandchildren while he was creating new psychology and intelligence tests.Whatever her IQ，Dottie was considered no dummy.</p>

The entire text of the item read: “Frankfurt，Germany，Aug. 2 (Reuters)——Pvt. Newton Graham of Scarsdale，N.Y.，committed suicide at La Rochelle，France，the United States Army announced today.”Newton——named after Sir Isaac Newton——was the second of Graham’s sons to be named Isaac Newton; the first had died of meningitis at age nine. Noting Newton’s increasing mental instability，which he labeled “highly neurotic，even probably schizophrenic，”Graham had written letters trying to get him discharged from the army，but failed.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0028.html#notes435" id="notes435n">20</a>. Using the term “pay”loosely，since all of the earnings are not actually paid out as a dividend. This distinction was once the subject of heavy academic debate as to the discount that should be imputed to a stock’s valuation for earnings that were not paid out. The premium assigned to companies that pay dividends has waned for a number of reasons. See also the reference to “The Frozen Corporation”in Chapter 46，“Rubicon.”</p>
