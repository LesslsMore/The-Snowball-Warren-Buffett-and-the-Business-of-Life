It was amended in 1966 and again in 1970 to further restrict the nonbanking activities of one-bank holding companies (such as Berkshire). In 1982，it was amended to further forbid banks from engaging in insurance underwriting or agency activities. In 1999，the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed parts of these acts.</p>

These terms，arguably，are the most lenient Buffett ever struck and suggest how badly he and Murphy wanted to buy ABC.

Although，as this book illustrates，Buffett shared ideas with some of these investors in the early days——for example，when he was short on capital——more often the use of similar rules led them to similar veins of ore.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes164" id="notes164n">45.</a> One subtle underpinning of EMH was a free-market，quasilibertarian philosophy that aligned with the spirit of deregulation and Reaganomics，under which investors could fend for themselves as free agents in an unfettered self-regulating market. Thus one side effect of EMH was to subtly build support for other types of market deregulation and for government and Federal Reserve actions that arguably contributed to later asset bubbles.</p>

The two models are not only related，but have the same basic flaw，which is that “earthquake events” are never factored in correctly——because if they were，the model would reveal a prohibitively high cost of capital.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes170" id="notes170n">51.</a> With the introduction of equity index futures in 1982，Buffett started trading these instruments as a hedge. Nevertheless，he wrote Congressman John Dingell，chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee，warning about their risk，and likewise wrote to Don Graham，“So much for the many claims as to hedge and investment type utilization; in actual practice，virtually all contracts involve short-term highly leveraged gambling——with the brokers taking a bite out of every dollar of public participation.” Letter from Warren Buffett to Mr. and Mrs. Don Graham，January 18，1983.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes173" id="notes173n">54.</a> Berkshire had $4.44 billion of assets on its books at the end of 1986，including $1.2 billion of unrealized gains on equities. Liquidating before the reform，Berkshire itself could have avoided paying any taxes，with the shareholders paying their 20% tax on the gain，or $244 million. If BRK liquidated after the Tax Reform Act took effect，Berkshire would be paying $414 million in corporate taxes (more than $185 million of which would have accrued to Buffett)，before handing over the net proceeds to investors to pay a double tax，adding up to a maximum of a 52.5% tax on the $1.2 billion unrealized appreciation，or $640 million. Thus the total effect was $400 million. See also James D. Gwartney and Randall G. Holcombe，“Optimal Capital Gains Tax Policy: Lessons from the 1970s，1980s，and 1990s，”A Joint Economic Committee Study，United States Congress，June 1997.</p>

Notably，much of that benefit is effectively offset by Berkshire Hathaway’s taxes. Since the Reagan years，Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy have been studying the annual reports of the top 250+ companies in the U.S.，always coming to the conclusion that they are severely underpaying.

Coo Nguyen，<span class="italic">Corporate Taxes</span> &amp; <span class="italic">Corporate Freeloaders</span> (August 1985)，<span class="italic">Corporate Income Taxes in the 1990s</span> (October 2000)，<span class="italic">Corporate Income Taxes in the Bush Years</span> (September 2004). The top 250 companies in the U.S.，while growing profits substantially，have consistently been shown to pay a fraction of the actual corporate tax rate throughout the 1980s，’90s，and today，due to breaks for depreciation，stock options，research，etc. Berkshire，however，has averaged a 30% effective tax rate (net earnings before taxes，divided by the taxes paid currently) since 1986——offsetting Buffett’s personal tax benefits. Regardless，Buffett’s taxes are irrelevant to whether he is entitled to criticize supply-side policies.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes192" id="notes192n">73.</a> Salomon bought the Minorco block itself at $38，a 19% premium to the stock’s $32 market price. It then offered Buffett the stock at the same price. The premium was typical for similar deals at the time (which were also criticized). The stock conveyed 12% voting power in the firm. Perelman offered $42 and said he might raise his stake to 25%.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes193" id="notes193n">74.</a> Salomon made a number of missteps. It took on a buyout of TVX Broadcast Group that ultimately failed，muffed a leveraged buyout of Southland Corporation，and wound up holding the bag on a problematic Grand Union buyout. After five unsuccessful years，Salomon exited the merchant-banking business in 1992.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes198" id="notes198n">79.</a> According to Graham and Dodd，preferred stocks marry the least attractive features of equity and debt.“As a class，” they wrote，“preferred shares are distinctly more vulnerable to adverse developments than are bonds.” Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd，<span class="italic">Security Analysis</span>，<span class="italic">Principles and Teaching</span>. New York: McGraw-Hill，1934，Chapter 26. Preferreds are often described as “bonds with a kicker，” combining the safety of a bond with the upside of a stock. However，as Graham and Dodd note，this is not really correct. If a company gets in trouble，preferreds lack an enforceable claim to the interest and principal. When things go well，unlike a common stock，the investor has no right to the company’s profits. Speaking at the University of Florida in 1998，Buffett said，“<span class="italic">The test of a senior security is whether you are getting an above-average return</span>，<span class="italic">after tax</span>，<span class="italic">and feel certain of getting your principal back.</span>” Here，the preference to the common was meaningless.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes199" id="notes199n">80.</a> Beginning October 31，1995，in five installments over four years，it was mandatory to either convert into Salomon stock or “put” it back to the company for cash. Perelman offered to beat Buffett’s deal——and Gutfreund and several other managers told the board they would quit. He offered a conversion price of $42，much more attractive from Salomon’s point of view. He would have owned only 10.9% of Salomon，compared to Buffett’s 12%.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0062.html#notes200" id="notes200n">81.</a> If a potential buyer for his block of convertible preferred appeared，Buffett was obliged to offer Salomon first refusal. Even if it did not buy back the shares，he was prohibited from selling his entire block to any one purchaser. Berkshire also agreed to limit its investment in Salomon to no more than 20% for seven years.</p>

The rout began as the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate over Labor Day weekend 1987. Over the next month，the market wavered and showed signs that investors were nervous. On October 6，the Dow broke a one-day record when it fell 91.55 points. Interest rates continued to climb. The Dow dropped another 108 points on Friday，October 16. Professional money managers spent the weekend pondering. On Black Monday，October 19，many stocks failed to open at all in the early hours of trading and the Dow fell a record-breaking 508 points. The exact cause of the crash remains in dispute. Program trading and equity index futures accelerated the decline，but economic factors，military tensions，comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about the dollar，a slowing economy，and other factors have been blamed.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes262" id="notes262n">11.</a> Feuerstein went back into the conference room after talking to Munger and repeated the “thumb-sucking” comment to another lawyer，Zach Snow，without further context. He did not seem to have grasped its significance，according to Snow in an interview. Feuerstein says Munger said，“Warren and I do that all the time.” Whatever the wording，neither Feuerstein nor Buffett took alarm at Munger’s remark.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes264" id="notes264n">13.</a> Feuerstein had had breakfast with one director，Gedale Horowitz，and told him much the same story，slightly more informatively，on the morning of August 8.

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes266" id="notes266n">15.</a> Munger’s later statement that he dragged this out of Feuerstein differs from Feuerstein’s recollection. Both agree that Munger was given a clear description. There is no question that Buffett and Munger’s overall interpretation of the actions of both Feuerstein and Gutfreund grew harsher as more information came to light.</p>

In such a fire sale，assets would sell for a fraction of their carrying value. The apparently invincible balance sheet of Salomon would melt into bankruptcy’s black hole immediately.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes279" id="notes279n">28.</a> Mozer didn’t report an existing net“long，”“when-issued” position in Treasury bonds that put it over the limit，and he also submitted another false bid in the name of Tiger Management Company.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes280" id="notes280n">29.</a> Mozer denied intentionally manipulating the market. He was suspected of“repo-ing out” the bonds by borrowing cash from customers with the bonds as collateral and making verbal side agreements with these customers that they would not relend the bonds to anyone. That froze the supply of bonds，squeezing the short-sellers. Suspicions of price-fixing dogged Salomon long afterward. There was little doubt that Mozer and his customers had cornered the bonds and created a squeeze. According to Eric Rosenfeld，Salomon’s own arb desk was short Treasuries and got burned.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes282" id="notes282n">31.</a> Feuerstein didn’t find this out right away，even though it was known internally. He blames this omission for his failure to press for a more thorough investigation of the squeeze. Several people，including Meriwether，apparently knew about the “Tiger dinner” (named after one of the hedge-fund customers). However，the “Tiger dinner” did not prove collusion.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes285" id="notes285n">34.</a> While this was taking place，Salomon filed a shelf registration statement in connection with a $5 billion senior debt offering，which the directors signed. The filing of a registration statement under these circumstances potentially put the firm in violation of securities laws.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes286" id="notes286n">35.</a> Some thought the squeeze may have been simply a matter of timing to make a bet that the Fed was about to ease interest rates，according to Eric Rosenfeld，rather than defiance of the Treasury.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0064.html#notes293" id="notes293n">42.</a> The auctions of December 27，1990 (4-year notes)，February 7，1991 (the so-called “billiondollar practical joke”)，and February 21，1991 (5-year notes) contained false bids. The April 25，1991，auction included a bid in excess of the amount authorized by a customer. In the May 22，1991 (2-year-notes) auction，Salomon (Mozer) failed to report a net“long” position to the government，as required，which fueled suspicions of a cover-up of market manipulation，but proof of market manipulation was never found.</p>

Buffett and Munger were also incensed to learn that at the June audit committee meeting，with Feuerstein present，Arthur Andersen represented that no events had taken place that were required to be reported to the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange.

Salomon’s action was highly unusual at the time and remains unusual. In 2005，KPMG’s refusal to pay its partners’ legal fees became the subject of lawsuits. In July 2007，a U.S. federal judge dismissed a case against thirteen KPMG employees for promoting aggressive tax shelters，because he determined that the government had strong-armed KPMG into denying them legal payments.</p>

All of Salomon’s growth in earnings for several years had been given back to employees. Salomon performed in the bottom third of stocks in its market-cap class. The third-quarter-income statement would have been drenched with red ink had not the lower bonus pool reversed it. The previous “share the wealth” approach subsidized money-losers so that everyone was richly paid. Buffett’s biggest change was to link bonuses to individual and division performance. For the five years ending December 31，1991，Salomon Inc.’s stock ranked 437th in performance among S&amp;P’s top 500 stocks. (1991 Salomon Inc.，10K)</p>

NewYork: Ballantine Books，1968; Thomas Malthus，<span class="italic">An Essay on the Principles of Population. The Population Bomb</span> was based on the work of the nineteenthcentury demographer and statistician Thomas Malthus，who said that humans procreate in a geometric rather than arithmetic progression; thus the earth’s population would inevitably expand beyond the point at which its resources could support it. At some point，Malthus postulated，misery and vice (e.g.，war，pandemic，famine，infant mortality，political unrest) would reduce the population to a sustainable level. Malthus’s theory had enormous influence on many scientists，induding Charles Darwin. Because Malthus failed to take into account a number of factors for example，simplistically assuming that economic development stimulated population growth——his ideas were and continued to be ridiculed as predicted catastrophes failed to materialize within a decade or two after 1970. The basic concepts of Malthus and the idea of the Malthusian catastrophe are being taken more seriously in some quarters today，however.</p>

Hardin’s theory was essentially a restatement of the “prisoner’s dilemma，” which also addresses cooperation and “cheating” as covered in references on that subject. In the 1970s it was assumed that economic progress would accelerate population growth，that population growth would prevent economic growth. The earth’s “carrying capacity” was assumed to be essentially fixed，rather than at least somewhat flexible through the use of technology and market forces，incorrect assumptions that caused such forecasts to peg the dates of critical population levels too early.</p>

Knopf，1977). While a full treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this book，what seems clear，from his change in terminology，steering of the Buffett Foundation，and gradual distancing from the Hardin camp，was Buffett’s disenchantment with the Malthusian views of Hardin because of their eugenics implications. (Hardin’s personal stationery featured a small U.S. map around the words“Quality of the Population.”)</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0066.html#notes475" id="notes475n">56.</a> A similar term，“Ovarian Roulette，” was apparently first used by Dr. Reginald Lourie of Children’s Hospital，Washington，D.C.，at a hearing of the Committee on Government Operations，United States，“Effect of Population Growth on Natural Resources and the Environment，” September 15-16，1969，in a discussion with Garrett Hardin，to describe a mother who takes the risk of an unwanted pregnancy by not using birth control (and the term has since been used by Responsible Wealth). However，it is the second word——“lottery” versus “roulette”——that changes a bad choice to bad luck: from a child who is born unwanted to a woman who trusts to random chance，to a child who is born in cruel circumstances because of random chance.</p>

The Ovarian Lottery resembles Rawls’s view，which is a form of determinism——and assumes that much，though not necessarily all，of what happens to people is <span class="italic">determined</span> by the present and past，for example，through their genes，or the luck of where they are born and when. The opposite of determinism is free will. From the days of the earliest philosophers，mankind has been debating whether free will exists. Philosophers also debate whether it exists on a scale or is irreconcilable with determinism. Critic Robert Nozick，in <span class="italic">Anarchy</span>，<span class="italic">State</span>，<span class="italic">and Utopia</span>，gives the case for irreconcilability in a critique of Rawls that more or less says that economist Adam Smith’s invisible hand gives people what they have earned and deserved (<span class="italic">Anarchy</span>，<span class="italic">State and Utopia</span>. New York: Basic Books，1974). All true libertarians believe in free will and deny absolutely that determinism exists. Since economic policy is so influenced by these ideas，the topic is worth understanding; for example，it sheds light on the debate over how Alan Greenspan’s libertarian leanings influenced Federal Reserve policy that led to recent debt-fueled asset bubbles. Likewise，the debate over eugenics in genomism and reprogenetics resounds with issues of determinism and free will.</p>

Unlike at the <span class="italic">Buffalo News</span>，for example，the employees’ base pay at a bank is too low to compensate for the labor value of their time that is owed by the shareholders. In effect，much of the bonus is really salary. The reason that a plan that requires employees to work almost for free in a bad year to compensate for “excessive” bonuses in other years cannot succeed is that it transfers some of the risk assumed by capital onto the backs of labor. The bonus structure of Wall Street——without the glue of partnership——is inherently problematic.</p>

Setting an exchange ratio implicitly required a view on equities and interest rates，as well as the underlying businesses’ prospects.

Miller，in “Buffett Again Declines to Flinch at Market’s High-Wire Act，” <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span>，May 5，1998，got it. He attended the shareholder meeting at which Buffett reiterated his views and commented that maintaining return on equity was a particularly vexing issue. On the other hand，Justin Martin and Amy Kover，in“How Scary is this Market，Really?” (<span class="italic">Fortune</span>，April 27，1998)，wrote that “no less an authority than Warren Buffett” had endorsed the market bulls through his “not overvalued” statement.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0068.html#notes543" id="notes543n">22.</a> On August 22，1997，Wells Fargo stock nosedived after Berkshire Hathaway reclassified it from the publicly filed form 13-F to the confidential disclosure to the SEC，creating the appearance that Buffett had sold his position in Wells Fargo. The SEC announced that it would consider tightening the confidentiality rules. In June 1998，the SEC announced it was tightening its “13F” rule that had allowed Buffett to file confidentially for a year while building large stock positions. Although the SEC did not absolutely rule out confidential filings，Buffett heard the footsteps. Berkshire Hathaway fought an aggressive battle with the SEC over this issue as its confidential filings were denied，and lost. In 1999，Berkshire filed confidentiality requests each quarter along with its regular 13-F forms containing positions that were not confidential. The SEC made a single announcement relating to these three filings that certain of the positions they contained must be publicly disclosed. Buffett’s right to make a profit presumably was not part of the SEC’s deliberations. The SEC’s interest is to protect investors. While the SEC staff had long held that it is desirable to prevent extraordinary fluctuations in stock prices unrelated to fundamental factors so that investors do not profit or suffer as a result，investors’ right to know the identity of a company’s largest shareholders outweighed that.</p>

The silver represented 20% of the world’s annual mine output and 30% of the above-ground vault inventory (Andrew Kilpatrick，Of <span class="italic">Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett: More in ’04</span>，<span class="italic">California Edition.</span> Alabama: AKPE，2004)，purchased on terms to avoid disrupting world supply.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0071.html#notes584" id="notes584n">18.</a> Buffett measures his performance not by the company’s stock price，which he didn’t control，but by increase in net worth per share，which he did. There is a link between these two measures over long periods of time. In 1999，book value per share had grown only 1/2 of 1%. But for the acquisition of General Re，book value per share would have shrunk. Meanwhile，the stock market as a whole was up 21%. Buffett called it a fluke that book value had increased at all，pointing out that in some years it will inevitably decrease. Yet only 4 times in 35 years under Buffett，and not once since 1980，had Berkshire done worse than the market by this measure.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0072.html#notes608" id="notes608n">16.</a> Buffett was not the only one concerned about the implication of this relationship. John Bogle，retired chairman of Vanguard，wrote of it in April 2001. However，he concluded that“some version of reality” had returned to the stock market. What made Buffett’s speech noteworthy was not use of this particular metric but rather his pessimistic projection of what it meant.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0072.html#notes609" id="notes609n">17.</a> One of Buffett’s main points was that companies——many of which had been taking gains from surpluses out of their pension plans——were irresponsibly using unrealistic rates of return assumptions and would have to adjust these to reality，which would show the plans to be less well funded or even underfunded.</p>

In 1999，Daft had to report the first loss in a decade and take a total of $1.6 billion of charges. Then，in lQ2000，Daft reported Coke’s second quarterly loss in a row——charges for massive restructuring/layoffs and a write-down of excess bottling capacity in India.

(The company doesn’t present cents per share in its financial statements.) To a B shareholder，it would be 3/10 of a penny per share. It’s very hard to make a case that an amount so small would incent Buffett to do something so contrary to Coca-Cola’s interests as to force it to turn down a big contract with Burger King in order to keep selling Coca-Cola at Dairy Queen. That would be so even if Berkshire owned zero Coca-Cola stock. The problem with the ISS approach was its absolutist checklist approach that applies no reasoning and proportionality.</p>

Mr. Strobhar has a curious history. After serving as a leader in the boycott against Berkshire that resulted in canceling the shareholder-contributions program，he wrote an editorial in the <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span>，“Giving Until It Hurts” (August 1，2003)，criticizing the shareholder-contributions program for being a clandestine way of“paying” Buffett (Notwithstanding that Berkshire made no corporate charitable contributions nor paid a dividend). Strobhar identified himself only as the president of an investment firm in Dayton，Ohio，omitting his role in the boycott and the fact that he was chairman of Life Decisions International. Strobhar went on in 2005 to found Citizen Action Now，an organization designed to fight “the homosexual agenda” and for “an America free from the manipulation of homosexual groups.” On the website of his investment firm，he borrows Buffett’s reputation by advertising himself (as of November 2007) as “trained in the tradition of Ben Graham，the ‘father of security analysis，’ whose students include Warren Buffet [sic]，‘the world’s greatest investor.’...

Buffett expected，as was reasonable，that the price of Berkshire’s stock would increase by at least 5% a year (through modest growth and inflation). Thus，the dollar value of the gifts was likely to remain level or even increase from year to year. During the year between the first gift and the second，Berkshire’s stock price went up 17%. The first 602,500-B-share distribution was worth $1.8 billion，compared to the second 572, 375-B-share distribution worth $2 billion. In June 2006，BRK was trading at $91,500 (B shares at $3, 043).</p>

The worm burns its way out through the skin by emitting an excruciatingly painful acid，emerging a few inches a day as sufferers wind it around a twig. They often seek relief by plunging into water，where the erupting worm releases a cloud of larvae to begin the cycle anew. The Carter Center and other nongovernmental organizations are tantalizingly close to wiping out the guinea worm.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0079.html#notes808" id="notes808n">25.</a> After Susie’s death，both of her apartments in San Francisco’s Pacific Heights were sold，as was the Buffetts’ second house，“the dormitory，” in Emerald Bay. Buffett kept the original house in Emerald Bay，which continues to be used by his children and grandchildren. He never goes there.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0079.html#notes809" id="notes809n">26.</a> On December 12，2007，major central banks began to provide funding at terms longer than overnight，and began to auction funding against a broader range of collateral and with a broader set of counterparties. The Federal Reserve activated swap lines to help the other central banks provide liquidity in dollars to their markets.</p>

  <p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre13" href="../Text/part0079.html#notes810" id="notes810n">27.</a> Using the return on capital figure he achieved for shareholders through 2007 as a proxy，the author estimates that Buffett (not including Susie’s shares) would have been worth between $71 and $111 billion by the end of 2007 had he continued to charge his“partners” fees. Susie’s stake would have been worth another $3 million-$745 billion. The difference between the high and low range is the fee structure (Buffett’s former 25% plus 6% interest on capital to all partners——the high number——vs. the 2%/20% structure of most hedge funds today——the low number). The calculation assumes that Buffett took out the equivalent of his 6% a year for living expenses，as he typically did while running the partnership. That amounts to $1 million per year by 2007. His and Susie’s (really Susie’s) living expenses exceeded this by a wide margin; however，Buffett’s personal investments——not part of Berkshire——also compounded at an astonishing rate and could (and did) fund Susie’s lifestyle without further withdrawals from Berkshire.</p>

Gen Re grew its book value at an average of 12.8% since 2001，bringing its capital to more than $11 billion，compared to $8.6 billion when it was acquired. General Re made a $526 million profit from underwriting on premiums of about $6 billion——compared to earlier losses of between $1 and $3 billion (depending on the year) on premiums of just under $9 billion.
